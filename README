      NOTE
*****************

THIS VERSION IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!  While I have put considerable time and effort into making this port functional, I have not yet polished it to the level of dsixda's original.  There are some menu options that are not fully documented and your update.zip may fail to flash if you do not clean up the update-script prior to packaging.  YOU MUST USE OPTION 19 prior to building to ensure all the symlinks are correct.

Also, keep in mind that most custom ROMS use some sort of lagfix, wherein your /data and/or /system partitions are non-RFS.  This is generally good, but can be problematic when flashing "stock" roms.  Make sure you disable lagfix through the CWM menu prior to flashing a custom ROM.
